## OPEN POSITIONS
 1. **Postdoc position (Sydney, Australia -- remote start possible)** to work on blood cancers, induced pluripotent stem cells, single cell multi-omics, and a number of other really exciting biomedical systems. The ideal candidate has some experience with single cell data analysis, understanding of linear algebra and/or network analysis, and is interested in leading their own research agenda. [Ad here]({static}/images/Advertisement_13042021_2.docx.pdf), write Fabio for inquiries. 

 2. **PhD student position (Sydney, Australia - remote commencement possible)**: "Building a standard model of cell biology". Half a century ago, the standard model of particle physics was established, which rests all natural phenomena in the universe on a handful of elementary particles and on the interactions between them. We aim to develop a similarly ambitious program for organismal biology by *characterising all known cell types in the body and all interactions between them* with a bottom-up approach. Although the complexity of the human body is staggering, surely it cannot compete with the complexity of the whole universe? Time to find out.

## How to apply
Contact Fabio at [fabio.zanini@unsw.edu.au](mailto:fabio.zanini@unsw.edu.au):
<!-- - **Postdocs**: we have one position available (see [announcement](/postdocopening012020.html)) for cell atlas construction. -->

- **Postdocs**: Send a CV, a description of research interests, and the names and contact information for at least two references. There are many fellowships [out there](https://asntech.github.io/postdoc-funding-schemes/).

- **PhD students**: We accept students from UNSW through the [Scientia](https://www.scientia.unsw.edu.au/scientia-phd-scholarships) and the [Graduate Research](https://research.unsw.edu.au/graduate-research-scholarships) programs. Write Fabio with a CV and a page of research interests.

- **Honours students**: We generally welcome candidates motivated to mix computational and molecular biology projects. Send one paragraph of research interest and one about your favourite lecture.

- **Research interns (computational)**: We are always considering highly motivated research interns to work on a number of computational problems in single cell systems biology. Examples of projects: interpretable decision trees to navigate cell atlases, identify potent antibodies against dengue virus, compressing cell atlas representations, learning the language of immune cells via ligand-receptor analysis.

- **Research interns (experimental)**: We are considering an experimental research intern to study outlier cells that behave differently from the mass via time-lapse microscopy.

![Rainbow flag]({static}/images/LGBT_Rainbow_Flag_small.png) We actively encourage people with **underrepresented backgrounds** (e.g. of aboriginal or Torres Strait island descent, minority groups, LGBTQ) to apply and promise to create a **welcoming** learning environment irrespective of social background.
