I am a postdoctoral scholar with an interest in single cell biology and virology, especially using single cell transcriptomic tools
to investigate virus-host interplay in severe dengue.

[t DOT jue AT unsw DOT edu DOT au](mailto:t.jue@unsw.edu.au)

I am a postdoctoral scholar and my research interest revolve around the use of next generation sequencing technologies
to understand the mechanisms of immunotherapeutic strategies for malignant primary brain tumours, specifically glioblastoma.
Beyond work, I love travelling and exploring the outdoors with my husband and daughter.
