I am a postdoctoral scholar and my research interest revolve around the use of next generation sequencing technologies
to understand the mechanisms of immunotherapeutic strategies for malignant primary brain tumours, specifically glioblastoma.
Beyond work, I love travelling and exploring the outdoors with my husband and daughter. 

## Carsten Knutsen

[cknutsen AT stanford DOT edu](mailto:cknutsen@stanford.edu)

I am a life science research professional working on the role of mesenchymal cells in the neonatal lung.
I am excited about studying and elucidating complex biological systems. I enjoy working with large datasets such as high-throughput screens and single-cell data.
Outside of the lab, I like to spend my time mountain biking, rock climbing, and baking.

[klavinap AT tcd DOT ie](mailto:klavinap@tcd.ie)

I am a third year biochemistry student visiting from [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Biochemistry/) and I am interested in molecular and single cell biology. I am excited to dig deeper and find out things about the human body that are still unknown. I am currently working on elucidating the role of stromal cells in the neonatal lung.


## Yasir Kusay

[y DOT kusay AT student DOT unsw DOT edu DOT au](mailto:y.kusay@student.unsw.edu.au)

I am a third year Bioinformatics Engineering student with a passion for coding. I am interested in the clinical use of high-throughput sequencing as a diagnostic tool, especially for bacterial infections. I am working on efficient network algorithms within the [igraph](https://igraph.org/) library.
