## Single cell immunology of severe dengue
Dengue is the most widespread mosquito-transmitted viral disease with 400 million infections every year. Millions of people including children and pregnant women suffer from severe symptoms such as internal bleeding and organ failure, but the pathogenesis of severe dengue is unclear. We are developing new single-cell transcriptomic approaches (experimental and computational) to understand what different parts of the immune system are doing during severe dengue.

## Hybrid classification and clustering of single cell tumor samples
Cell atlases are huge collections of single cell transcriptomes that describe in extreme molecular detail the composition of human tissues. We are pioneering new algorithms to leverage cell atlases to rapidly elucidate the composition of tumor biopsies.
