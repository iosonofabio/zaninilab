### We give a voice to each single cell of the body to show that diversity is an asset, not a liability.

#### OPEN POSITION for a PhD student on "Building a standard model of cell biology". See [details](pages/jointhelab).

# Projects
[Fabilab](pages/contact) is driven by [people](pages/people), not [academic boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity). We proudly work on biology, medicine, data science, computer science, network science and, sometimes, math.

## Biology of the neonatal lung

**The lung is a very special organ at birth**, carrying pathogens and chemically reactive oxygen right into the center of our bodies. Our lab is [mapping](https://elifesciences.org/articles/56890) the staggering cellular diversity characterizing neonatal lungs in terms of gene expression (left) and anatomical location (right). A deeper understanding of this fundamental biological system will help us treat the lung conditions affecting thousands of newborn babies every year, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.


## Immunology of severe dengue

**Dengue** is the most widespread mosquito-transmitted viral disease with 400 million infections every year. We are developing [new](https://elifesciences.org/articles/32942) [approaches](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/E12363) to understand what different parts of the immune system are doing during severe dengue. We identified CD163 as a biomarker for severity in monocytes and patented [new antibodies](https://elifesciences.org/articles/52384) against dengue virus.


## Graph clustering of tumor transcriptomes

**Cell atlases** are huge collections of single cell transcriptomes that describe in extreme molecular detail the composition of human tissues. We are pioneering [new algorithms](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/820928v1) to leverage cell atlases to rapidly elucidate the composition of tumor biopsies.


## Network science
![igraph]({static}/images/research/igraph.png)

We develop [igraph](https://igraph.org/), a high-performance network analysis [tool](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jesus_Cortes-Rodicio/post/Can_anyone_suggest_any_papers_about_bibliometric_software/attachment/59d61ddb79197b807797b0d5/AS:273730993885186@1442273962343/download/iGraph.pdf) that underpins many software packages in single cell biology and beyond.
