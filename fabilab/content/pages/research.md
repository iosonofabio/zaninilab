### We give a voice to each single cell of the body to show that diversity is an asset, not a liability.

#### OPEN POSITION for a Postdoc shared with John Pimanda on blood cancers & stem cells. See [ad]({static}/images/Advertisement_13042021_2.docx.pdf).

#### OPEN POSITION for a PhD student on "Building a standard model of cell biology". See [details](pages/jointhelab.html).

# Projects
[Fabilab](pages/contact.html) is driven by [people](pages/people.html), not [academic boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity). We proudly work on biology, medicine, data science, computer science, network science and, sometimes, math.

## Gene networks regulating leukemic cell state transitions
![Embedding AML cells]({static}/images/research/umap_aml.png)

**Cancer cells are not equal in the face of therapeutics.** Within a single patient, even within a single Petri dish, heterogeneity in gene expression and function distinguishes more stem-like cells, which are more likely to cause relapse, from more differentiated cells. We are developing [data exploration techniques](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.26.353797v1.full) to reveal how the transition between these cancer cell states is regulated and how it can be perturbed chemically, with the vision to reduce relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

## Biology of the neonatal lung
![Neonatal lung immunity]({static}/images/research/lung_immune.png)

**The lung is a very special organ at birth**, carrying pathogens and chemically reactive oxygen right into the center of our bodies. Our lab is [mapping](https://elifesciences.org/articles/56890) the [staggering](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441649v1) cellular [diversity](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.444776v1.full) characterizing neonatal lungs in terms of gene expression (left) and anatomical location (right). A deeper understanding of this fundamental biological system will help us treat the lung conditions affecting thousands of newborn babies every year, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.


## Immunology of severe dengue
![Severe dengue]({static}/images/research/severe_dengue.png)


**Dengue** is the most widespread mosquito-transmitted viral disease with 400 million infections every year. We are developing [new](https://elifesciences.org/articles/32942) [approaches](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/E12363) to understand what different parts of the immune system are doing during severe dengue. We identified CD163 as a biomarker for severity in monocytes and patented [new antibodies](https://elifesciences.org/articles/52384) against dengue virus.


## Graph clustering of tumor transcriptomes
![northstar]({static}/images/research/northstar.png)

**Cell atlases** are huge collections of single cell transcriptomes that describe in extreme molecular detail the composition of human tissues. We are pioneering [new algorithms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71805-1) to leverage cell atlases to rapidly elucidate the composition of tumor biopsies.


## Network science
![igraph]({static}/images/research/igraph_with_plot.png)

**Graphs or networks are an essential mathematical object in modern systems biology.** Together with some [amazing](https://www.traag.net/) [folks](http://szhorvat.net/pelican/), we develop [igraph](https://igraph.org/), a high-performance network analysis [tool](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jesus_Cortes-Rodicio/post/Can_anyone_suggest_any_papers_about_bibliometric_software/attachment/59d61ddb79197b807797b0d5/AS:273730993885186@1442273962343/download/iGraph.pdf) that underpins many software packages in single cell biology and beyond.
