Our preprint with the Alvira and Cornfield labs is out! What happens to our lung immune cells when we inhale our first breath of air? Oxygen and pathogens!

[https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.942359v1](https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.942359v1)

We discovered that **right before birth** the lung immune landscape in mice is dominated by a **highly specific type of macrophage (Mac I)** that is proliferative and expresses tissue remodeling genes over pathogen defense genes. These cells **beautifully encircle small blood vessels**.

Fast forward to **one day after birth**, and **a Pandora box has been opened**! Four different kinds of macrophages with multiple subtypes within; three kinds of dendritic cells; B, T, NK, and innate lymphoid cells; basophils and mast cells, and a diverse set of neutrophils.

Three weeks into air-breathing life and lung immunity starts looking like an adult tissue, with lots of lymphocytes and a gene expression that relates to pathogen protection.

Thank you to all authors for their amazing work, and special thanks to Racquel Domingo-Gonzales (my co-first author), Xibing Che (soo many experiments!), and Michael Swift (the lymphocyte expert).
