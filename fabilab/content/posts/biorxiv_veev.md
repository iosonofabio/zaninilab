Our preprint on endothelial cell development in the neonatal lung is out!

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441649v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441649v1)

While many single cell papers describe all endothelial cells in their data set as a single cluster of "vasuclar" cells, we focused specifically on those cells in the context of the mammalian neonatal lung and - guess what! - we discovered an amazing degree of interesting diversity.

Thank you to all authors for their amazing work, and special thanks to Cristina Alvira who did so much work on this!
