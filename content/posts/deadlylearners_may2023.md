Today Catherine and Fabio had an awesome educational session with the Aberdeen public school children organised by [Deadly Science](https://deadlyscience.org.au/), an amazing organisation that broadcasts STEM materials and knowledge to rural and remote communities.

It was great fun and to yes - microscopes are almost magic!
