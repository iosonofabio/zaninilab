## OPEN POSITIONS
 **Master/honours/PhD student position (Sydney, Australia)**: "Gene thieves: how a nudibranch incorporates the stinging cells of the Bluebottle jellyfish". This project, with co-supervision by [Amandine Schaeffer](http://www.oceanography.unsw.edu.au/), aims to understand the evolutionary adaptation of gene stealing in bluebottle jellyfish and blue sea dragons.

 **Paid intern position (Sydney, Australia)**: "Interactive network analysis charts in igraph and Python". Nov 2021-Jan 2022 [Project description]({static}/images/intern_fabilab_igraph_2021.pdf)


## How to apply
Contact Fabio at [fabio.zanini@unsw.edu.au](mailto:fabio.zanini@unsw.edu.au):
<!-- - **Postdocs**: we have one position available (see [announcement](/postdocopening012020.html)) for cell atlas construction. -->

- **Postdocs**: Send a CV, a description of research interests, and the names and contact information for at least two references. There are many fellowships [out there](https://asntech.github.io/postdoc-funding-schemes/).

- **PhD students**: We accept students from UNSW through the [Scientia](https://www.scientia.unsw.edu.au/scientia-phd-scholarships) and the [Graduate Research](https://research.unsw.edu.au/graduate-research-scholarships) programs. Write Fabio with a CV and a page of research interests.

- **Honours students**: We generally welcome candidates motivated to mix computational and molecular biology projects. Send one paragraph of research interest and one about your favourite lecture.

- **Research interns (computational)**: We are always considering highly motivated research interns to work on a number of computational problems in single cell systems biology. Examples of projects: interpretable decision trees to navigate cell atlases, identify potent antibodies against dengue virus, compressing cell atlas representations, learning the language of immune cells via ligand-receptor analysis.

- **Research interns (experimental)**: We are considering an experimental research intern to study outlier cells that behave differently from the mass via time-lapse microscopy.

![Rainbow flag]({static}/images/LGBT_Rainbow_Flag_small.png) We actively encourage people with **underrepresented backgrounds** (e.g. of aboriginal or Torres Strait island descent, minority groups, LGBTQ) to apply and promise to create a **welcoming** learning environment irrespective of social background.
