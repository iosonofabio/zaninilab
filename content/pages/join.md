## OPEN POSITIONS
<!-- **PhD student position (Sydney, Australia)**: "_Linking viral infection of pancreatic cells with type-1 diabetes by single-cell virology_". This project, with co-supervision by [Ki-Wook Kim](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/ki-wook-kim), aims to use single-cell omics to characterise the molecular link connecting pancreas infection by enteroviruses and Type-1 diabetes pathogenesis in children. [Project description]({static}/images/type1_diabetes_project.pdf) -->

**Postdoc/Data Engineer position (Sydney, Australia or remote)**: "_Light and scalable cell atlas approximations_". This project aims to develope rapid and usable approximations of cell atlases by using lossy compression algorithms, API design, and web interfacesy. [Project description]({static}/images/cell_atlas_approximations_project.pdf).

 **Honours/PhD student position (Sydney, Australia)**: "_Gene thieves: how a nudibranch incorporates the stinging cells of the Bluebottle jellyfish_". This project, with co-supervision by [Amandine Schaeffer](http://www.oceanography.unsw.edu.au/), aims to understand the evolutionary adaptation of gene stealing in bluebottle jellyfish and blue sea dragons.

## How to apply
Contact Fabio at [fabio.zanini@unsw.edu.au](mailto:fabio.zanini@unsw.edu.au):
<!-- - **Postdocs**: we have one position available (see [announcement](/postdocopening012020.html)) for cell atlas construction. -->

- **Postdocs**: Send a CV, a description of research interests, and the names and contact information for at least two references. There are many fellowships [out there](https://asntech.github.io/postdoc-funding-schemes/).

- **PhD students**: We accept students from UNSW through the [Scientia](https://www.scientia.unsw.edu.au/scientia-phd-scholarships) and the [Graduate Research](https://research.unsw.edu.au/graduate-research-scholarships) programs. Write Fabio with a CV and a page of research interests.

- **Honours students**: We generally welcome candidates motivated to mix computational and molecular biology projects. Send one paragraph of research interest and one about your favourite lecture.

- **Research interns (computational)**: We are always considering highly motivated research interns to work on a number of computational problems in single cell systems biology. Examples of projects: interpretable decision trees to navigate cell atlases, identify potent antibodies against dengue virus, compressing cell atlas representations, learning the language of immune cells via ligand-receptor analysis.

- **Research interns (experimental)**: We are considering an experimental research intern to study outlier cells that behave differently from the mass via time-lapse microscopy.

![Rainbow flag]({static}/images/LGBT_Rainbow_Flag_small.png) We actively encourage people with **underrepresented backgrounds** (e.g. of aboriginal or Torres Strait island descent, minority groups, LGBTQ) to apply and promise to create a **welcoming** learning environment irrespective of social background.
