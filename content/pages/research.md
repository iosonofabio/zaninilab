### We give a voice to each single cell of the body to show that diversity is an asset, not a liability.

# Research
[Fabilab](pages/contact.html) is driven by [people](pages/people.html), not [academic boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity). We proudly work on biology, medicine, data science, computer science, network science and, sometimes, math. We are enthusiastic leaders in [night science](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1800-6) and love to generate new ideas and - why not - mix things up. If you like our work, shoot us an [email](mailto:fabio.zanini@unsw.edu.au): we reply to every single one.

Below is an (incomplete) list of our current projects.

## Single-cell gene expression with HTSeq 2.0
![HTSeq]({static}/images/research/htseq2.png)

**HTSeq is a software library to analyse high-throughput sequencing data in Python**. It is particularly popular to quantify gene expression in bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data via its ``htseq-count`` script. We have been maintaining *HTSeq* for many years and have developed [HTSeq 2.0](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac166), adding specific support for single cell experiments, exon-level expression, and a dedicated new API to manage islands of dense genomic data sprinkled in data deserts.


## Graph clustering guided by a cell atlas
![northstar]({static}/images/research/northstar.png)

**Cell atlases** are huge collections of single cell transcriptomes that describe in extreme molecular detail the composition of human tissues. We are pioneering [new algorithms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71805-1) to leverage cell atlases to rapidly elucidate the composition of tumor biopsies.

## Scalable network analysis with igraph
![igraph]({static}/images/research/igraph_with_plot.png)

**Graphs or networks are an essential mathematical object in modern systems biology.** Together with some [amazing](https://www.traag.net/) [folks](http://szhorvat.net/pelican/), we develop [igraph](https://igraph.org/), a high-performance network analysis [tool](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jesus_Cortes-Rodicio/post/Can_anyone_suggest_any_papers_about_bibliometric_software/attachment/59d61ddb79197b807797b0d5/AS:273730993885186@1442273962343/download/iGraph.pdf) that underpins many software packages in single cell biology and beyond.


## Gene networks regulating leukemic cell state transitions
![Embedding AML cells]({static}/images/research/umap_aml.png)

**Cancer cells are not equal in the face of therapeutics.** Within a single patient, even within a single Petri dish, heterogeneity in gene expression and function distinguishes more stem-like cells, which are more likely to cause relapse, from more differentiated cells. Using our [northstar](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71805-1) algoritm, we developed [data exploration techniques](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/doi/10.1182/blood.2020009707/476046/Disruption-of-a-GATA2-TAL1-ERG-regulatory-circuit?redirectedFrom=fulltext) to reveal how the transition between these cancer cell states is regulated and how it can be perturbed chemically, with the vision to reduce relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

## Virus-inclusive single cell omics of dengue infection
![Severe dengue]({static}/images/research/severe_dengue.png)


**Dengue** is the most widespread mosquito-transmitted viral disease with 400 million infections every year. We are developing [new](https://elifesciences.org/articles/32942) [approaches](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/E12363) to understand what different parts of the immune system are doing during severe dengue. We identified CD163 as a biomarker for severity in monocytes and patented [new antibodies](https://elifesciences.org/articles/52384) against dengue virus.


## Single-cell biomedicine of the neonatal lung
![Neonatal lung immunity]({static}/images/research/lung_immune.png)

**The lung is a very special organ at birth**, carrying pathogens and chemically reactive oxygen right into the center of our bodies. Our lab is [mapping](https://elifesciences.org/articles/56890) the [staggering](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441649v1) cellular [diversity](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.444776v1.full) characterizing neonatal lungs in terms of gene expression (left) and anatomical location (right). A deeper understanding of this fundamental biological system will help us treat the lung conditions affecting thousands of newborn babies every year, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
